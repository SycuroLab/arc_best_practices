1. Slurm sbatch job to run blastn.

# Run slurm job script using sbatch and save to a shell variable called job_id.
job_id=$(sbatch < blastn_sbatch_job.sh )

# Print the job id using the $job_id variable.
echo $job_id
Submitted batch job 16634408

# Check job resource usage with seff command
seff $job_id

2. Slurm sbatch job to run blastp.

# Run slurm job script using sbatch and save to a shell variable called job_id.
job_id=$(sbatch < blastp_sbatch_job.sh )

# Print the job id using the $job_id variable.
echo $job_id
Submitted batch job 16634423

# Check job resource usage with seff command
seff $job_id  

3. Run blastn using cpn60 UT nucleotide sequences as the query and genome fasta files as the database.

# Get the list of of full file paths for the genome fasta files using ".fa" file extension and write to a file.
find ../genome_files -type f -name "*.fa" > genome_fasta_file_list.txt

# Need to know how many genome we have so that we can know how many indexes in the job array we need.
wc -l genome_fasta_file_list.txt
6 genome_fasta_file_list.txt

# Run the slurm batch job.
job_id=$(sh blastn_genomes_sbatch.sh)

# Print the job id.
echo $job_id

# See job resource usage.
seff $job_id

4. Run blastn using cpn60 UT protein sequences as the query and genome fasta files as the database translated in six-frames.

# Run the slurm batch job.
job_id=$(sh tblastn_genomes_sbatch.sh)

# Print the job id.
echo $job_id

# See job resource usage.
seff $job_id
