Slurm Blast Job Arrays.

1. Run blastn using cpn60 UT nucleotide sequences as the query and genome fasta files as the database.

# Get the list of of full file paths for the genome fasta files using ".fa" file extension and write to a file.
find ../genome_files -type f -name "*.fa" > genome_fasta_file_list.txt

# Need to know how many genome we have so that we can know how many indexes in the job array we need.
wc -l genome_fasta_file_list.txt 
6 genome_fasta_file_list.txt

# Run the slurm job array.
job_id=$(sh blastn_genomes.sh)

# Print the job id.
echo $job_id

# See job resource usage.
seff $job_id

2. Run blastn using cpn60 UT protein sequences as the query and genome fasta files as the database translated in six-frames.

# Run the slurm job array.
job_id=$(sh tblastn_genomes.sh)

# Print the job id.
echo $job_id

# See job resource usage.
seff $job_id
